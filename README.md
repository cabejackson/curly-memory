# Noteful Client

This is a neat app that helps you organize your notes into folders!

### Check it out --> https://cabejackson.github.io/curly-memory/

To see it in action, you'll need to run "npm start" on the noteful-json-server provided by Thinkful!

### Here's a more thorough explanation of how to get started (note to self lol!):

    git clone https://github.com/tomatau/noteful-json-server
    cd ./noteful-json-server
    npm install
    npm start
    note: you can press Ctrl-c to close the server
